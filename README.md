## Chasing Your Tail
This is a fork of [Chasing Your Tail](https://github.com/azmatt/chasing_your_tail) by azmatt. I thought the project was interesting and could grow into something neat.

My goals are to:
1. Refactor the code to be more modular - this should make expansion and future contribs easier.
1. Remove hardcoded file paths
1. Create an install script
1. Add some interaction/lookups with wigle.net API
1. Add more wireless technologies
