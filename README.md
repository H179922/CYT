## Chasing Your Tail
This is a fork of [Chasing Your Tail](https://github.com/azmatt/chasing_your_tail) by azmatt and [ShadowGuard](https://github.com/nobodynate/ShadowGuard) by nobodynate

I'd been trying to get this work last year and had a bunch of trouble, so if this is somehow useful for others I figure I'll see if I can make a mess of sharing it (first timer).  

I'm going about this in no particular order

- chasing_your_tail.py
- I was getting an error initially
- 'Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/auser/ShadowGuard/cyt/chasing_your_tail.py", line 16, in <module>
    cyt_sub.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

- Next
